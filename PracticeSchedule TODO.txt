- Fix the save method in the model class - it throws a null pointer exception around line 114

- schedule still is not saving the contents of the very last cell i.e notes
- add an actual time practiced column to table,

- add a total time practiced variable to the practice schedule class use properties to 	  set/get.  Display this in a non editable txt box and keep updating after a practice is complete.
- add a timer with a start,  stop and reset functions - how will these interact with the total time variable?
